I'm happy to announce that our first app, [The Bond Mixology], is now available for purchase in the [iTunes App Store]!  This fun app meticulously documents every drink (authentic recipes included) consumed by Bond across all 23 films.

This app is the perfect companion to your Bond related parties or movie marathons (we highly recommend the 5byBond movie marathon that [Dan Benjamin] and [John Gruber] have been running on [The Talk Show] over at [5by5]).
